  Recreated Google's homepage in HTML and CSS as part of The Odin Project's assignment. Learned about columns, grids, rows and especially positioning content in CSS. Had issues with proper image links and sectioning parent elements with child elements. Overall, had fun researching, failing, and reading throughout this entire process. I rank it 5/7.
